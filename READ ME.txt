This is a VERY simple linear fit calculator I've created to help (procrastinate) my studies of Calculus 4 (Numeric Calculus)

I've not used ChatGPT for help on this one... OK only to add commentaries because I was lazy
I plan to improve this if I feel like it, it's not hard to make a similar code for a parabola or etc

I'm very much not used to github I've no idea what I'm doing :)
